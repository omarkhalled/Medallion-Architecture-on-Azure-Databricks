# Medallion-Architecture-on-Azure-Databricks
 Designed and implemented a medallion architecture on Azure Databricks, using Unity Catalog for data governance and  Azure Data Lake Gen2 for storage. Created schemas with Spark SQL, ingested data from ADLS into the Bronze layer,  and transformed it into Silver and Gold layers to improve data quality and accessibility for downstream use cases.
